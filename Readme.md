# Test Case 04/2026

This is a fairly simple project that does not use any third-party packages or libraries, except for the SASS compiler.

## Details

1. Videos are loaded into HTML using JavaScript.
2. Video scrolling is implemented using native scroll and the CSS `scroll-snap-type` property, which greatly simplifies scroll handling.
3. Videos at positions -2 and beyond, and +2 and beyond from the active video are unloaded (only the poster remains).
4. Videos at positions -1 and +1 are preloaded.
5. The mute/unmute button works globally for all videos at once.
6. The progress bar is draggable.
7. Videos can be paused and unpaused. Each video resumes playback from the position it was paused at when you return to it.
8. Video loading via API is not supported; the application works with a predefined set of videos.
9. Infinite scroll is not implemented.
10. The interface is designed by me and reflects my subjective vision.

## Desktop Version Features

1. On desktop, there are buttons for scrolling up and down.

## Tablet & Mobile Version Features

1. On tablet and mobile devices, the up and down scroll buttons are not available.

## Launch Instructions

You can run the project by simply opening the `index.html` file, as all SCSS code has already been compiled and is located in the `/css` folder.

Alternatively, you can run the project in Visual Studio Code:

1. Install the **Live Sass Compiler** extension.
2. In the extension settings under **Settings: Formats**, set the `savePath` option to `/css`.
3. Install the **Live Server** extension.
4. Click **Watch Sass** in the VS Code status bar.
5. Click **Go Live** in the VS Code status bar.
6. The application will open in your browser.
